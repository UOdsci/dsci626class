#### Steps for building and installing minimal R package with tutorial

cd to directory with the package name

mkdir R

nano DESCRIPTION
# In file should simply include (for now):
Package: foundstats
Version: 0.1
#(update with future versions)

put any R scripts in the R directory (e.g. a dummy script for now, called learn_stats.R)

mkdir inst/
mkdir inst/tutorials/
mkdir inst/tutorials/rtutorial_1

put the rtutorial_1.Rmd file in rtutorial_1/

Invoke R from terminal, and assuming that devtools pkg has been installed:
make sure you are in the directory with the package name.
build()
install()

*This will write a package_name.vXX.tar.gz file in the dir. above your package directory.
